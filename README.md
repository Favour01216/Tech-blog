# Tech Blog

## Description

This is a project created for the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp class. The programme is a CMS-style blog site, similar to a Wordpress site, where developers may create blog articles and comment on the writings of other developers. The app's architectural framework follows the MVC paradigm, with Handlebars.js as the template language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
